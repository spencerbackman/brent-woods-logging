Presented by:


 

In this edition of The Downtown Explorer we feature the last Friday Night Live, Hunt and Gather Makers Market 2019, Pop Up Parks and the Food Truck Finale!
 
What an incredible Friday Night Live season it has been!

Come enjoy the last Friday Night Live presented by Buffalo Rock Company this Friday, October 25th, from 5-8pm on Northside Square!

Thank you to all the musicians and for everyone who has spent part of their Friday evenings in Downtown Huntsville since last May enjoying free live music!
 
Hunt and Gather Makers Market is back for another year this Saturday, October 26th, from 10am - 4pm! Join us at the former Regions Drive-Thru, on the corner of Holmes & Spragins, underneath the parking garage for an incredible day in Downtown Huntsville!

Hunt & Gather is an annual curated artisan and makers market, created to highlight creativity in North Alabama & the Tennessee Valley!

There will be around 50 hand-picked regional makers, artisans, craftspeople and creators - fresh tunes playing from the "Local Music Lounge" all day, and a fun party-like atmosphere to shop in and inspire your own creativity!

A special thanks to the presenting sponsor Colliers International Alabama!

 
The last weekend of Pop Up Parks is here in Downtown Huntsville! Enjoy the unique interactive parks until October 27th. A huge thank you to our sponsor SmartBank for making this event possible!

Pop Up Parks 2019 features parking spots converted into mini-parks around the Downtown Square. The event's motto: "Move out the cars, bring in the people." We invite you to come out, play on the mini-parks, and enjoy all the amazing things Downtown Huntsville has to offer.
